**Section 1.3.** **Purpose.** The Foundation is organized under the Washington Nonprofit Miscellaneous and Mutual Corporations Act (Chapter 24.06 of the Revised Code of Washington) (the "Act").

## Article II: Membership

**Section 2.1.** **Membership.** The Board shall adopt a policy (a "Membership Policy"), consistent with the Foundation's Articles of Incorporation, that defines the rights, responsibilities, qualifications, fees and all other matters associated with membership. The term "Members" means all individuals and entities that qualify for membership under this policy and that execute a Membership Agreement in a form adopted by the Board.

**Section 2.2.** **Intellectual Property.** All intellectual property submitted to or owned, adopted or created by the Foundation ("Intellectual Property") shall be subject to such license agreements, contribution agreements, policies and procedures as adopted by the Board.

**Section 2.3.** **Project Governance.** Open source software projects within the Foundation will be subject to a governance process adopted by the Board (a "Project Governance Policy"). The governance process will specify (i) the rights of the original contributor of a project to the Foundation to manage the project as a "benevolent director," (ii) the rights of the Foundation as to the project and its name, and (iii) the rights of the broader community to use the project, including what open source licenses may be used for projects and the policies for accurate and referential use of project names.

**Section 2.4.** **Founding Member.** Microsoft Corporation is the "Founding Member." The Founding Member intends that the right to manage the affairs of the Foundation be vested exclusively in the Board, as described in these Bylaws, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. The Founding Member and eligible Members will elect the Board as described in Section 3.3.

## Article III: Board of Directors

**Section 3.1.** **Powers.** The Board will direct all affairs of the Foundation and may exercise all powers available to a corporation under applicable law, including without limitation the power to authorize officers or agents to enter into contracts, execute financial instruments, and make other commitments on behalf of the Foundation. All corporate powers are exercised by or under authority of the Board.

**Section 3.2.** **Number of Directors.** The Foundation will have no fewer than three and no more than seven directors.

**Section 3.3.** **Board Composition.**

**(a) Board.** The Board shall consist of one director appointed by the Founding Member and up to six directors elected by Members.

**(b) Election Process.** The Board shall adopt a policy (the "Director Election Policy") that defines eligibility criteria for candidate directors, establishes length of term of service for elected directors, identifies which Members are entitled to vote for directors, and defines a process for the election of directors by eligible Members.

**(c) Director terms.** The director appointed by the Founding Member will serve until that person is replaced by the Founding Member or otherwise vacates the position. The Founding Member may replace its appointed director at any time in its sole discretion. Elected directors will serve for the term established in the Director Election Policy.

**(d) Resignation; Removal.** A director may resign at any time in their sole discretion, unless such resignation would cause the Foundation to have no directors. A director may be removed from office for any good cause deemed sufficient by the Board, voting in accordance with Section 3.9 below. In the event of removal of the director appointed by the Founding Member, the Founding Member will retain its right to appoint a director, but must not re-appoint the removed director.

**(e) Vacancies.** If there are vacancies in elected director positions due to resignation or removal, the remaining directors shall appoint additional directors to serve for the remainder of the term, as set forth in the Director Election Policy. A vacancy in the director position appointed by the Founding Member must be filled by the Founding Member within 30 days.

**Section 3.7.** **Compensation.** Directors shall not receive compensation for their services as such, although the reasonable expenses of directors for attendance at Board meetings or otherwise directly incident to their duties as directors may be paid by the Foundation.

**Section 3.8.** **Transactions with Interested Parties.** No contract or transaction between the Foundation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Foundation and any other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are directors or have a financial or other substantial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board or committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction or solely because his or their votes are counted for such purpose, if:

(a) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board, and the Board in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors, even if the disinterested directors are less than a quorum; or

(b) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Foundation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by the Board.

**Section 3.9.** **Meetings.**

**(a) Location; telephonic meetings.** The Board and any Board committees may hold regular or special meetings at any location worldwide or by any electronic means. Participation by telephone, videoconference or any similar means is sufficient provided that all meeting participants can concurrently communicate with each other, and such participation will constitute presence for the purposes of these Bylaws and the Act.

**(c) Regular and special meetings.** Regular meetings of the Board may be held at times determined by the Board and communicated to all directors. Any officer of the Foundation may call a special meeting, or any one director may call a special meeting if that one director is the only director in office. The party calling a special meeting must use all reasonable efforts to effect actual notice of the special meeting upon all other directors no less than two business days prior to the special meeting. Unless otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business may be transacted at a special meeting.

**(d) Quorum and voting.** Except as otherwise required herein, participation of a majority of the directors in office immediately before a meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at that meeting of the Board. Except as otherwise required by the Act or by these Bylaws, the act of the majority of the voting directors present at which a quorum is present will be an act of the Board. For the following actions, a vote by two-thirds of all directors then in office shall be required: (i) the dissolution or merger of the Foundation, or the transfer of all or substantially all of the Foundation's assets, (ii) changing the Foundation's purpose, (iii) amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, (iv) changing the Foundation's Membership Agreements, the Membership Policy, the Director Election Policy, the Project Governance Policy, or any Intellectual Property-related agreements or policies, or (iv) removal of the Foundation's officers or directors. Each director will have one vote.

**(e) Limited Special Right for Director Appointed by Founding Member.** In connection with any vote to materially change the Foundation's Membership Policy, Director Election Policy, Project Governance Policy, or any Intellectual Property-related agreements or policies, (a) a "no" vote by the director appointed by the Founding Member will result in the disapproval of a proposed action, regardless of the number of votes for approval), and (b) such director must be present as part of any quorum (i.e. if that director is not present, the Board will not have a quorum for the matter, regardless of the number of other directors present).

**(f) Member Review.** Prior to voting on any amendments to the Foundation's Bylaws, Articles of Incorporation or the Foundation's Membership Policy, the Director Election Policy, the Project Governance Policy, or any of the Foundation's Intellectual Property-related agreements or policies, the Board shall use reasonable efforts to preview the proposed amendments with the Foundation's Members, using the following process:

 (i) post the proposed amendments as "pull requests" within the Foundation's GitHub organization, or through such other methodology determined by the Board that is accessible to Members for review and feedback;

 (ii) notify Members via a public announcement and solicit Member comments to the proposed changes over a designated Member review period (no less than a week from the date of notice), to be submitted by Members via GitHub or such other forum or methodology adopted by the Board;
