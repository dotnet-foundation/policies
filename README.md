# .NET Foundation Policies and Bylaws

Welcome to the official community-managed repository for the policies, bylaws, and governance practices of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org).

This repository is the **collaborative source of truth** for how the Foundation is structured, decisions are made, and how we engage with the broader .NET community. It is designed to be transparent, inclusive, and version-controlled—ensuring that governance evolves in the open and with accountability.
